TARDIS stands for Tracking and Retreiving Data Interface Service. It is a set a application programming interfaces (APIs) for collecting provenance occurences and reporting them. 

TARDIS Collector API is used for collecting provenance for services within the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure.

TARDIS Analyzer API is used for retrieving and reporting that provenance for services using the Collector API. 

# Versioning

Each API is versioned independently. Currently the versions for each API are listed below: 

* Collector API, version 1.4-ALPHA (shortened to C.1.4a, or v1.4a)

* Analyzer API, version 1.0-ALPHA (shortened to A.1.0a)

Minor releases that are not currently stable will have codes like 'rc' for release candidate and these release candidates may be associated with an internal release.  These internal releases are made to the Quality Assurance group within iPlant and are noted as 'qa-#.'  An example is the tag ``v1.2rc-qa1``.  Deconstructing it, this is the version 1.2 first internal release candidate.
